## What is feijuca?

Feijoada is a portuguese dish, originary from the north of Portugal. It is a
dish made of beans and meat. In Brazil it is one of the most popular dishes,
commonly called *feijuca*.

This project only inherited this dish's name. It is a STD C library which
implements common algorithms using an object-oriented approach. Since it is
written in full compliance with C standards, it can be compiled in virually any
system that have a C compiler and support the STDC library.

## GNU Compliance

This library was designed to be fully compliant with GNU Building System. It
uses autotools to get built in your environment.

## History

This library was designed and implemented originaly by Ronaldo Faria Lima and
Daniel Costa Soares back in 2004. This code is more than 10 years old and is
pretty stable.

Feijuca was created to fill a gap. Back in 2004 there was no well-designed
algorithms library that would encapsulate data and that was easy to use.

## What makes Feijuca unique

Feijuca library is designed in an object-oriented fashion. It uses opaque data
structures so you can focus on your data, not on the algorithms.
