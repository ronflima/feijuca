@chapter Single circular linked lists in Feijuca Library
Feijuca Library implements the circular lists as single linked lists
where the tail of the list is linked back to the beginning. Since the
circular list is based on single linked lists, it is possible to
iterate through the list solely in one direction.

The circular lists routines are built on the single linked lists
routines. The functions that manages the circular lists are exactly
the same for the single linked lists. 

Thread safety is not guaranteed, since the lists are not expected to
be thread safe in this current release.

@chapter Data types

The following data types are defined for circular list implementation.

@itemize @bullet
@item fjc_clist_element_t:
Data structure that describes a circular list element. There is no
need to use this data type since this is used internally by the list
descriptor. This is, in fact, a typedef to the list_element_t data
type.
@item fjc_clist_t:
Data structure that decribes the circular list descriptor. This is
used to hold all needed data to implement the list. There is no need
to access directly any element of this structure since they are
manipulated by the functions of the library. This is, in fact, a
typedef to the list_t datatype.
@end itemize

Please refer to the list documentation for a complete set of
information on other data types.

@chapter Functions
All the functions in the fjc_clist.h header file are implemented as true
functions, even being wrappers to the list functions. The idea of
using real functions is to ensure data type checking for the circular
list data types.
